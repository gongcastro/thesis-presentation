* The average English 20-year-old knows around 42,000 words
* The collection of words that an adult knows is known as the *mental lexicon*
* The *mental lexicon* is formed by *lexical representations*, each embedding phonological, conceptual, and grammatical information about known words
* In the last five years, we have explored the initial lexicon through the lens of a particular case of language learning: bilingual infants
* The foundations of a lexicon are laid by the first form-meaning mappings at 6 months
* Two sources of evidence: inter-modal experimental paradigms and parental reports

* Here I show normative data for a large sample of CDI administrations
* Until 18 months, vocabulary size grows steadily from 0 to approx. 100 words
* From 18 months on, infants acquire new words at an increasingly faster rate, and know on average around 400 words

::: notes
- There are reasons to think that, a priori, bilingual infants should lag behind their monolingual peers in lexical development
- I highlight three reasons.
- First, bilinguals face a more complex linguistic environment, as they have two learn two partially overlapping codes instead of one (two grammar systems, two sets of words, two phoneme inventories, etc.)
- Second, they do so while facing a reduced linguistic input, relative to monolinguals. Because their input is split into two languages, they are exposed to a lower degree to each language than monolinguals.
- Third, bilinguals face increased referential ambiguity. They not only need to learn word-referent associations like monolinguals, they often have to associate more than one label per referent, one in each language

- Despite these challenges, bilinguals reach most of their language acquisition milestones at equivalent ages as monolinguals
- This is specially true for lexical development
- For instance, I highlight this study by Hoff et al. (2012), in which they collected English and Spanish CDI administrations for a cohort of English monolinguals and English/Spanish bilingual children living in Florida.
- Both groups were matched across many demographic variables, like SES
- When the authors compared monolingual and bilingual vocabulary sizes in each language separately, they observed that English monolinguals knew more English words on average than bilinguals.
- But when English and Spanish vocabulary sizes were combine into a measure of total vocabulary size, monolinguals and bilinguals' trajectories of vocabulary growth were equivalent.
- This begs the question: *How do bilinguals keep up with monolinguals despite facing a more challenging lingusitic environment*?

**Higher lexical similarity, larger vocabulary size**

Stronger effect in the additional language (e.g., Dutch, Mandarin)

::: notes
- Recent studies have suggested that bilinguals might exploit the lexical similarity between their languages to boost the vocabulary growth.
- In an influential monograph published in 2019, Floccia et al. collected vocabulary data from a large sample of bilingual 2-year-olds in the UK.
- These children were learning English and an additional language, out of a diverse sample of 13 other languages from different typological families, linguistic groups, or that followed different grammatical systems.
- Most children were English-dominant, but were exposed to the additional language in verying degrees
- The authors calculated a measure of lexical similarity for each pair of languages.
- For each language pair, they calculated the average phonological similarity between the translation equivalents included in the English vocabulary checklists and in each of the other additional languages
- This measure was included as a predictor in a model that estimated participants' vocabulary size in each of their languages
- This index of lexical similarity turned out to be positively related with children's vocabulary size in their additional language
- For instance, English-Dutch bilinguals (learning two lexically similar languages) knew more Dutch words than Enlgish-Mandaring (low similarity languages) knew in Mandarin
- Overall, these results pointed to lexical similarity as a possible facilitator of word acquisition
:::

## Lexical similarity modulates vocabulary acquisition in bilinguals

![](assets/img/similarity.png)

::: notes
- Such a facilitation effect would have important consequences for some populations of bilinguals.
- For instance, most infants in Catalunya learn Catalan and Spanish simulataneously.
- The languages share a high lexical similarity.
- In fact when using the method to calculate lexical similarity than in Floccia et al., we find that Catlaan and Spanish share around double as much similarity than English and Dutch, the pair of languages with the highest similarity included in the study

**What *mechanisms* support a cognate facilitation during word acquisition?**
:::

::: notes
- What makes two languages lexically similar is mostly the presence of *cognates*, or form-similar translation equivalents.
- *Cognates* are words that belong to two different languages, but share an equivalent meaning and are phonologically or orthographically similar
- A clear example of a cognate in Catalan and Spanish is *gat*-*gato* [cat]
- A clear example of a non-cognate is *gos*-*perro* [dog]
- There is some recent evidence that cognates are acquired earlier than non-cognates
- This would explain the facilitation effect of lexical similarity found by Floccia et al.
- But what are the mechanisms behind such a cognate facilitation effect?
:::

## Lexical access is language non-selective in bilinguals

![](assets/img/lexicon.png){ width="150%" }

::: notes
- Current explanations of this effect stem from the language non-selective account of the bilingual lexicon
- This account states that during language comprehension and production, lexical representations from both languages are activated, even during monolingual situations
- For instance, when a Catalan-Spanish bilingual hears the Catalan word *cotxe*, not only the lexical representation of *cotxze* is activated, but also that of other phonologically related words in Catalan and Spanish
- There is extensive evidence in adults that this activation, which also percolates to semantic representations, influences the dynamics of word comprehension and production.
- There is some evidence of such parallel activation in infants.
- It has been suggested that this parallel activation of representations in both languages may facilitate the acquisition of cognates in infants, given that they are more strongly co-activated, given their higher similarity, compared to non-cognates.
- But this effect still lacks a mechanistic account

- I present here the *Accumulator Model of Bilingual Lexical Acquisition* or AMBLA
- This is an *accumulator* model, in that it assumes that infants learn words by gradually accumulating information about word-referent mappings.
- Information is collected by the child in the form of *learning instances*
- We define learning instances as exposure to tokens of the word that result in the successful accumulation of information about their meaning
- We assume that an infant acquires a word when they have accumulated some threshold amount of learning instances with
- The age at which this occurs is the acge of acquisition of the word
- The rate at which an infant accumulates learning instances is a function of two variables: they age (older infants will have accumulated more learning instance than younger infants), and the lexical frequency of the words (infants will accumulate learning instances faster for more frequent words than for less frequent words)

::: notes
- Following the language non-selective account of the bilingual lexicon, we assume that infants co-activate translation equivalents in both languages, even in monolingual situations
- The strength of this co-activation is a function of the phonological similarity between both word-forms
- During language exposure cognate words will be more strongly co-activated than non-cognate words
- As a result of this co-activation, when an infant encounters a given word-form in their speech inpt, they may not only accumulate a learning instance for such word, but also for its translation equivalent
- The degree to which the translation accumulates this additional learning instance is a function of its phonological similarity between both word-forms
- This is expressed in the model by adding a new term to the learning instance accumulator
- This term adds the number of learning isntances that the translation eequivalent of the word has acquired, weighted by the phonological simlarity between them
- This phonological similarity is measured using Levenshtein distance between both phonological transcriptions
- As a result, identical cognates will accumulate cross-lingusitic learning isntances with every exposure to either translation, while words with no phonological similarity will not benefit from any additional learning instances

- We gathered 436 questionnaire administrations from 366 12-32 month-old infants learning Catalan and or Spanish in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona
- We modelled the probabiity that each child would understand or produce each of the words

- The critical predictors were the main effect of $Cognateness$, and its interaction with $Exposure$
- First I am going to present the results for *comprehension*
- In this figure I am showing the posterior predicted probability of comprehension across ages for three average word-forms
- I am showing predictions for an identical cognate with 100% phonological similarity with its translation
- I am also showing the predictions for a non-cognate with 50% similarity, and 0% similarity
- Predictions are generated for word acquisition in the lower-exposure language (to the left) and for the higher-exposure language (to the right)
- In the lower-exposure language, we observed a substantial facilitation effect of cognateness: the probability of acquisition grows faster for cognates
- In the higher-exposure language, this effect was not observed

::: notes
- In summary, we found an earlier acquisition of cognates than non-cognates, in line with the predictions of AMBLA
- This effect was modulated by quantitative language-exposure
- Only the acquisition of words from the lower-exposure language benefitted from their cognate status 
- This cognate facilitation provides an candiate mechanism for the results in Floccia et al.
- We presented a mechanistic account for this effect in the form of a model, the AMBLA model
- In this model, we propose that the cognate facilitation effect is the result of a cross-language accumulation of learning instances, in line with the language non-selective account of the bilingual lexicon
- One core assumption of this model is that bilingual infants activate phonological word-forms in both languages in parallel, even in monolingual situations

Methodological pitfalls: "Bilingual" task

::: notes
- ALthough there is some evidence of language non-selectivity in the initial lexicon, most literature presents one methodological caveat
- The experimental paradigms used frequently present participants with words from both languages, even within the same trial
- This may be introducing bilinguals in a bilingual context in which the baseline activation of lexical representations in both languages is increased
- This may lead to cross-language interactions that may not be the result of the experimental manipulation of interest (e.g., priming), but rather from such overall higher activation

## Discussion

<br>

**Successful spoken word recognition** across ages and language profiles

. . .

**No evidence of priming effects**, within or across languages

> Unsuccessful retrieval of prime phonological forms?

. . .

Inconclusive results, revise design
