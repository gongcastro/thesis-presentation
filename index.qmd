Average English-native 20-year-old knows ~42,000 words: **mental lexicon**

Lexical representations
: Phonological, conceptual, grammatical information of known words
:::


::: {.notes}

* The average English 20-year-old knows around 42,000 words
* The collection of words that an adult knows is known as the *mental lexicon*
* The *mental lexicon* is formed by *lexical representations*, each embedding phonological, conceptual, and grammatical information about words
* Building a lexicon is not a trivial task, as we will see now
* Yet, the foundations of a lexicon are laid very early in age
* In internal workings of this initial lexicon are still unclear

:::

## Overview

* **Introduction**:
    - From speech sounds to words
    - Bilingualism and its challenges
    - The role of phonology (cognateness)
* **Study 1**: AMBLA model, acquisition of cognates, role of language exposure
* **Study 2**: language non-selectivity in the initial bilingual lexicon
* **Discussion**

::: notes

* In the last five years, we have explored the initial lexicon through the lens of a particular case of language learning: bilingual infants
* In this presentation, I will first provide an overview of how words become relevant linguistic units to infants
* Second, I will elaborate on the specific challenges that bilinguals face in their vocabulary acquisition journey. In particular, how bilinguals manage to keep up with monolinguals in their vocabulary acquisition trajectories, despite facing a more complex linguistic environment.
* Third, I will describe some recent insights into how phonology (and in particular, the lexical similarity between the two languages),
and on some unresolved issues that we have addressed in the present dissertation
* Fourth, I will formally present a model that proposes a candidate mechanism to explain how cognateness boosts lexical acquisition in bilinguals
* I will then present the first empirical study of the dissertation, in which we generate and test the central predictions of the model
* In the second empirical study, we test one of the central assumption of the model
* Finally, I summarise the main insights of our work, and discuss its implications for current understanding of the initial bilingual lexicon, limitations, and future steps.

1. From sounds to lexical representations
2. Vocabulary spurt
3. Early dynamics of lexical processing


## From sounds to lexical representations

::: notes

* Before birth: auditory system developed, identification of familiar melodies
* At birth: language discrimination based on prosodic cues (e.g., rhythm)
* Universal discrimination of phonemes
* Perceptual skills tuned to native language from ~4-6 mo until 12 mo
* First word-form representations
    - Familiar word-form recognition: phonologically detailed
    - Speech segmentation: syllable co-occurrence, stress patterns, phonotactics, etc.

# Study 1

Cognate beginnings to lexical acquisition

## Introduction

Bilinguals keep up with monolinguals in vocabulary growth

The presence of cognates seems to facilitate vocabulary acquisition

Language co-activation has been suggested to underlie this phenomenon

What mechanisms are support the role of co-activation in cognate acquisition?
